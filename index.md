Hi.

My name is Gon√ßalo -- good luck pronouncing that -- and I've been in the software industry for the better part of 10 years. Over all this time I've been collecting some thoughts on process, method, and the craft of Software Engineering. Seeing as how my partner shows absolutely no interest in them, I thought I might as well publish them online.

If you've ever wondered what happens inside an SW engineer's head, well you're in the right place.

It is probably worth mentioning -- read: critically important to mention -- that the opinions herein are solely mine, and do not represent the opinions of any present, past, or future employers. Any overlap between these texts and the stated views of any of those people and companies is pure coincidence, and probably a matter for study.

Here's a list of pages published here so far:

* [Code as a Point in an Infinite Space](<0010 - Code as a Point in an Infinite Space>)

Happy reading!
